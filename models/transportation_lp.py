Transportation Linear Programming Model
=====================================

This module implements a simple transportation problem using linear programming.
The objective is to minimize transportation costs while satisfying:
1. Warehouse capacity constraints
2. Customer demand constraints

Problem Structure:
- Decision Variables: x_ij = units shipped from warehouse i to customer j
- Objective: Minimize total transportation cost
- Constraints: 
  * Warehouse capacity limits
  * Customer demand requirements
